Flæskesteg

The traditional method of preparation is to roast a joint of pork from the breast or neck without 
removing the rind. So as to obtain crispy crackling, a sharp knife should be used to cut the skin through 
to the meat in narrow strips. The skin is rubbed with salt, pepper is added, while bay leaves and 
optionally cloves are inserted into the cuts. The joint is then roasted in a hot oven. The dish is 
traditionally accompanied by both boiled potatoes and caramelized potatoes (brunede kartofler). 
The caramelized potatoes are prepared by melting sugar in a frying pan over strong heat, adding a 
clump of butter, and allowing a portion of small, round, peeled, preboiled potatoes (available in cans)
 to bathe in the mixture until they become richly browned or caramelized. Red cabbage (rødkål), 
 which can be bought in a jar or a can, is always included too. If the cabbage is prepared from scratch,
  sliced apples are often added.
